## Safe3

Safe3 is a revolutionary web3 platform designed to empower users with actionable knowledge while ensuring their safety within the decentralized ecosystem. It bridges the gap between education and security by offering a dual-functionality system: a browser extension (Defender), and a web3 dapp (Studio). Together, these tools enable users to stay informed about potential risks and learn how to effectively interact with decentralized applications (dapps).
Safe3 not only fosters awareness but also incentivizes content creators (tutors) with tokenized rewards for their contributions, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem of education and safety.

With Safe3, users can:
1. Receive real-time warnings and guidance while using dapps through the Defender browser extension.
2. Access educational articles and videos tailored to specific dapps via the Safe3Studio platform.
3. Contribute to the web3 community by sharing valuable insights and earning Safe3Points token.
